## Introduction
 This is an application for a user who would like to be able to view create and track daily workouts. They are dedicated to exercise, and want to be able to log multiple unique exercises in a workout on a given day. With this app, they will be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. When engaging in cardio exercise such as running, walking or biking, the user is able to track the distance that they have traveled. 

## Usage 
In order to run the application, open the server.js file in integrated terminal, to install the dependencies:
* `npm install express`
* `npm install mongoose`
* `npm install morgan`

Then run the command `node server.js` if the connection is successful, you will see the console log:

 `App is listening on PORT` followed by the port number.

## Challenges
<br>
 While the actual work of writing the code for this application was a challenge, in the end the part that I struggled with the most was the actual deployment on Heroku. 

I had to create a new user a number of times in Atlas, and reconnect to Heroku in order to finally have the application run properly outside of running it locally.
